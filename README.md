# IBM_Terminal_QMK_STM32_microadapter

My attempt to design a very small and very cheap USB converter for IBM Model M terminal keyboards.

Intended to fit in between the pins of a 5 pin DIN 270Â° female connector, with a PCB edge USB A connector.

V0.2 now should actually match the pins of a DIN connector. Make sure to use the updated version of the keyboard config with the latest pinout for the F042.
